# Ghost Developer Docs

## Docs

- [Overview](https://docs.ghost.org/admin-api.md): It’s possible to create and manage your content using the Ghost Admin API. Our content management interface, Ghost Admin, uses the admin API - which means that everything Ghost Admin can do is also possible with the API, and a whole lot more!
